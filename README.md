## Your goal

A famous restaurant is loosing customers lately because of a lack of innovation...  
They need you (a fancy senior cook üßë‚Äçüç≥) to help them with something fresh and new.

- Hence, they are asking you to create a new menu including the following **categories**:
  - Starters
  - Seafood
  - Chief's special
  - Main dishes
  - Desserts

- All of those categories will need **few recipes** in them with the following:
  - name 
  - ingredients
  - description (fancy if possible)

During the service, the team will need an app to display them what to focus on. Hence, **a small interface** with each category and how to handle the preparation will be needed.  
PS: At this part of the exercise, you could let the whole team access the app with a single username + password combo (like `supercrew` + `secretsaucepwd`).

### If you do have some spare time
- The restaurant will have a designated crew specialized in their own field, like a `sauce chef`, `vegetable chef` and so on... You can get an example of a possible hierarchy on [this page](https://www.highspeedtraining.co.uk/hub/kitchen-hierarchy-brigade-de-cuisine/).  
Please do handle the fact that a chef **will not have a recipe tied to something that he cannot do**.
- If your crew feels creative, you can provide the ability to **create**, **edit** and **delete** the recipes of each specialized chef's category.
- A search field can be added to look quickly for a **dish name** or a specific **ingredient**.
- Feel free to create something original

### Technical info
- Use [this project](https://github.com/TulioMolina/graphql-recipes-api) to have a ready GraphQL project. It's easy to setup and works well as a backend. Any feedback or change on it's schema will be appreciated during the interview review.
- The configuration of your Nuxt app is totally flexible. You can install and configure GraphQL/Apollo as you want.
  - The use of Vuex is up to you.
- You can host the whole but it's not required.
- Since the main focus is not on the styling, you can totally import any CSS framework that you'd like.
